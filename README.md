Imports and setup Libraries
Imports necessary libraries/modules for file handling (os), image processing (cv2), numerical operations (numpy), visualization (matplotlib.pyplot), dataset splitting (train_test_split), and deep learning (tensorflow and its components).

Load Dataset
Basic Preprocessing Steps for Brain Tumor Detection

After loading the files, the initial preprocessing steps involve:

Converting Color Format: The images are converted from BGR to RGB format since the OpenCV library reads images in BGR by default.

Resizing Images: All images are resized to a predefined size to ensure uniformity and consistency in dimensions.

Organizing Data: The resized images are appended to lists along with their corresponding labels, facilitating easy access and management during subsequent analysis.

Defines a function load_images to load and preprocess images from a specified directory. It iterates through each subdirectory, assigns labels based on subdirectory names ('yes' for tumor, 'no' for non-tumor), reads images using OpenCV, converts them to RGB format, resizes them to a target size (default is 128x128), and appends them to lists along with their labels. Finally, it returns images and labels as NumPy arrays.

Exploratary Data analysis
Defines a function display_sample_images to display sample tumor and non-tumor images from the dataset using Matplotlib. It takes images, corresponding labels, and the number of samples to display as input.

Data Scaling and Transformation
Since our data consists of images and images consist of pixels, we divide all the pixel values by 255—each pixel can have a value in [0, 255]— so that all the pixel values are on the same scale i.e. [0, 1].

Result
I have achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%

Conclusion
In this notebook, we explored the realm of brain tumor detection, focusing on the utilization of simple yet effective methodologies. By leveraging basic techniques, we aimed to provide accessible and understandable solutions for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images.

Through our analysis, we underscored the critical importance of accurate diagnostics and classification in the treatment and management of brain tumors. With brain tumors posing significant health challenges worldwide, the need for efficient and reliable detection methods is paramount.

Our discussion highlighted the potential of automated systems utilizing Deep Learning Algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL), in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection. By harnessing the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can facilitate timely and precise diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Furthermore, we addressed the contextual challenges associated with brain tumor diagnosis, emphasizing the potential of cloud-based automated systems to bridge gaps in medical expertise and resources, particularly in underserved regions.

In conclusion, this notebook serves as a foundation for further research and development in the field of brain tumor detection. By integrating advanced technologies with accessible methodologies, we can strive towards more effective and accessible healthcare solutions for individuals affected by brain tumors.
